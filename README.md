Population Management System contains a list of locations and the total number of residents in each location broken down by gender.

The system was built for my D1 âž£ D2 advancement and provides an API that enables you to:

- Create a new location containing data on the total number of male and female residents within it.
- List all available locations and their population summaries (total male residents, total female residents, sum total residents)
- Preview data for a specific locations
- Update data for a specific locations
- Delete a specified location
